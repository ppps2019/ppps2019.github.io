The conference mobile app is the best way to view the conference technical program and other conference information. Any updates will be pushed to the mobile app daily. The PPPS 2019 app is available from the Apple App Store [PPPS 2019 - Apple App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppps-2019/id1457191911?mt=8) and for Android devices on Google Play [PPPS 2019 - Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.pcss.ppps2019).
