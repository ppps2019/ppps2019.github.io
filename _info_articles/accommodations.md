[DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel at the Entrance to Universal](http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/florida/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-at-the-entrance-to-universal-orlando-MCOUNDT/index.html) \\

FAX: +1-407-363-0106

Check back here for instructions for getting the group rate at this hotel.

Orlando has been rated the #1 best location for meetings in the USA.  Orlando is home to several of the best attractions in the world, including Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and Sea World.  In addition to other premier local attractions such as shopping and golf, there are also several popular attractions in driving distance from Orlando, including Kennedy Space Center, LEGOLAND and Daytona Beach.

PPPS 2019 will be held in the meeting space of DoubleTree at the Entrance to Universal, with Universal Studios located literally across the street and within walking distance.  DoubleTree at the Entrance to Universal is also the recommended hotel for lodging as we have negotiated a very low group rate and the meeting space is directly connected to the hotel.  The DoubleTree has just finshed a complete renovation of the meeting space and hotel rooms, which will provide a fresh, contemporary, venue for PPPS 2019.
