Please consider honoring a distinguished member(s) of our community by nominating them for an award.  The Pulsed Power Science and Technology Technical Committee (PPS&T/TC) honors contributions and achievements in the field of Pulsed Power through three distinguished awards: 

* _The Erwin Marx Award_ recognizes outstanding contributions to pulsed power technology by an individual over an extended period of time.

* _The Peter Haas Award_ recognizes outstanding contributions to pulsed power technology resulting from an individualâ€™s continued effort to develop programs of research, education, and information exchange that are the basis for progress in pulsed power.

* _The Arthur H. Guenther Award_ recognizes outstanding students in the field of pulsed power by identifying their unique achievements in the field of pulsed power science, engineering and technology development. 

The recipients of the awards will receive their honor at the 2019 Pulsed Power Plasma Science (PPPS) Conference in Orlando FL, which is the combined conference of the 22nd Pulsed Power Conference and the 46th International Conference on Plasma Science.
