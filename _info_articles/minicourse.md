As part of the International Conference on Pulsed Power and Plasma Science 2019, a special 1.5-day mini-course on Theoretical and Computational Plasma Physics will be offered. This mini-course will be tutorial in nature and it will cover theoretical modeling and computational approaches on several topics of current fundamental research. It will play an enabling role in bringing together experts in the fields so as to ensure optimal coordination among the fields. Some of the lecturers will describe latest progress of their discipline while others will offer overview lectures and review their present research interests and the context in which these areas of research are highly valuable. Participants at this conference will acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that will enable them to contribute to many areas of plasma science and technology. 

Theoretical models coupled with computational tools for a wide range of plasma conditions aim to advance our understanding of the plasmas created in the laboratories and are present in the cosmos. The theory can be used to make experimentally verifiable predictions and computational plasma physics provides powerful tools for searching ways to improve experimental designs and our confidence in them. Exponential growth of computer power means that a lot of important and interesting problems are becoming tractable by computer solutions.  Some of the examples are the theoretical simulations and diagnostic predictions of the High Energy Density (HED) Plasmas that are created in large experimental facilities for radiation sources and magnetic and Inertial confinement fusions providing some of the Nation’s technological basis for HED plasma experiments. Lecture presentations will include overview talks on non-LTE atomic and radiation kinetics for plasma and X-ray spectroscopy, quantum mechanical simulations of warm, dense matter, hydrodynamics simulation of HED Plasmas, Hall Physics in HED Plasmas, deep Learning: techniques for practitioners in the plasma sciences, tutorial on HEDP modeling with FLASH, PIC methods in plasma simulations, modeling vacuum electronic and high-power microwave devices, and microscale to nanoscale gas breakdown. Individual topics will be covered in one-hour presentations given by international experts in the field from several national laboratories as well as from several universities. Further information on the abstracts and instructors, and student tuition grants are posted on the conference website. A detail schedule of the mini-course can be found in the [Mini-course flyer]({% link assets/minicourse-flyer.pdf %}).

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
High-energy density plasmas (typically defined as plasmas with pressures exceeding 1 Mbar) are found in many different contexts including planetary cores, inertial confinement fusion etc. High power lasers with powers above Tera Watts have been successfully used to generate and diagnose these conditions. In this lecture, the physics involved in generating and modeling these plasmas with lasers will be discussed.  Multi-physics hydrodynamics codes include a large range of physics models spanning the interaction of the laser with the plasma, heat and radiation transport, static and transport material properties, and fluid flow.  Typical models for these properties will be described.  Comparison of simulation results with experiments will also be presented. Some aspects of high-energy density plasmas such as kinetic effects, laser plasma interactions are challenging to include in hydrodynamic codes. The limitations of modeling such plasmas with hydrodynamic approximations will be discussed.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
The warm, dense matter regime (WDM), which ranges over densities from solid to hundreds of times compressed and temperatures from a few to hundreds of eV, spans a diverse range of environments including, as examples, planetary interiors of solar and exo- planets; stellar atmospheres; ICF implosions; and intense, short-pulse laser-solid interactions. Such environments consist of complex dynamical concoctions of atoms, molecules, ions, and free electrons in which quantum mechanical effects play a critical role. Several quantum many-body techniques such as Monte Carlo, Green’s functions, and molecular dynamics have shown considerable versatility in treating these extreme conditions and the strong quantum influences. In this tutorial, we shall explore WDM and hot plasma systems with a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) as a representative approach that encapsulates the essential features of all the methods.. In the QMD, we solve the many-body Schrodinger equation for a large, representative sample of atoms, periodically replicated through space to effect the characteristics of a fluid, which may include a mixtures. For the electrons, we employ density- functional theory (DFT) in two guises: an orbital-based in the Kohn-Sham form and an orbital-free, usually in a Thomas-Fermi-Dirac approximation. This dual capability permits thorough coverage of these extreme conditions and provides a set of consistent static, dynamic, and optical properties such as equation of state (EOS), mass transport (viscosity/diffusion), opacity, and conductivity (thermal/electrical). We shall also discuss time-dependent (TD) formulations of both DFT approaches to calculate stopping power, conductivities, and interactions with electromagnetic fields.

<div id="garner" style="display:none;">
<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Historically, gas breakdown has been mathematically predicted by Paschen’s law based on the concept of the Townsend avalanche. Paschen’s law predicts that breakdown voltage increases without bound as the product of gap distance and gas pressure, pd, becomes large or small without bound and reaches a minimum at intermediate pd. Experimental studies as early as the 1950s noted deviations from this minimum breakdown voltage for microscale gaps at atmospheric pressure and hypothesized that they arose due to ion enhanced filed emission. These deviations become increasing important for microplasmas, where one desires a reproducible breakdown voltage at small scale, and in microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems where one strives to avoid gas breakdown for device reliability.<br>
The drive toward even smaller electronics motivates a detailed analysis of all relevant electron emission mechanisms to optimize system design to either create or avoid plasma formation as applicable. Several studies have experimentally, computationally, and analytically demonstrated the transition from Paschen’s law to field emission at microscale. More recent studies have shown that further reducing gap size at a given pressure causes electron emission to transition from field emission to space-charge limited emission either with collisions (Mott-Gurney) or in vacuum (Child-Langmuir). Even smaller gap sizes cause space-charge limited emission to transition to Schrödinger’s equation.  Moreover, the importance of the electrode surface structure on gas breakdown increases for submicroscale gaps, particularly the nonuniform electric fields that arise due to field enhancement or surface roughness and the implications of multiple breakdown events on electrode surface structure and subsequent breakdown events. This further motivates the development of Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations to assess the impact of collisions on electron emission and breakdown mechanisms at these small scales.  
This minicourse will provide a historical overview of the relevant breakdown and electron emission mechanisms, a theoretical perspective into their unification, and the implications of the transition between these mechanisms for various system parameters. The talk will also discuss the role of Monte Carlo simulations in feeding crucial physical parameters to each of these models apart from elucidating the electron dynamics in non-traditional operating regimes. Moreover, the integration and assessment of ongoing experiments at microscale and nanoscale to the theory and the extension of these theories and models to AC fields, particularly at microwave and terahertz frequencies, will be discussed.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
The x-ray radiation emitted by a non-LTE plasma can be used as a valuable tool for diagnosing its properties. Consequently, this can require detailed atomic physics models and a radiation transport method. This lecture will focus primarily on non-LTE atomic physics and radiation transport in 1-D using results from the NRL Drachma II code. Diagnostically analysis will be presented using isocontours of line ratios and powers.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
This lecture will discuss issues and methods concerning the use of non-LTE kinetics in plasma modeling.  Topics to be addressed will include characterization of plasma conditions for which non-LTE modeling is required and a survey of methods to fill that need.  Radiation transport is often an important component of non-LTE modeling.  The strong interactions between radiation and atomic kinetics produce strong numerical coupling, necessitating numerical methods tailored to reflect that coupling.  Computational approaches for these coupled systems will also be discussed.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Fluid models of plasma can have an enormous advantage over fully kinetic methods, such as the particle-in-cell methods, in the speed of numerical computation as well as for interpreting the results of simulations and experiments. The main limitation of fluid models is their domain of validity is restricted to collision-dominated phenomena. Assuming this is the domain of interest, then the question of what physics should one include in a fluid model becomes critically important. The magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) model is the simplest model that retains the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy when properly formulated, and for this reason it is widely used to model many plasma phenomena. It is even used in parameter regimes that are well outside of its domain of validity due to its computational simplicity. When one must use a model that goes beyond MHD, the question becomes: how does one extend the MHD model while still retaining the computational advantages of a fluid description and the MHD model in particular? The Hall effect is manifested in a term in the Generalized Ohm’s law and is the most important extension of MHD to a class of models often referred to as Hall-MHD (HMHD) or extended MHD (XMHD). However, including the physics of the Hall term can significantly increase the computational complexity and dramatically decrease the speed of the computation. For these reasons, progress in the development of robust HMHD computational models has been slow. In this talk I will introduce the Hall-MHD model and discuss the difficulties in the development of efficient methods. As the main focus of the talk, I will discuss a method that we have used with great success that is both computationally simple and efficient when compared to most other methods for simulating Hall physics. I will show results of relevance to the high-energy density plasma regime that exemplify the importance of the Hall physics.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Often without realizing it, we employ machine learning every day as we use our phones or drive our cars. Over the last few years, machine learning has found increasingly broad application in the physical sciences. This most often involves building a model relationship between a dependent, measurable output and an associated set of controllable, but complicated, independent inputs.  The methods are applicable both to experimental observations and to databases of simulated output from large, detailed numerical simulations.<br>
 
In this tutorial, we will present an overview of current tools and techniques in machine learning – a jumping-off point for researchers interested in using machine learning to advance their work.  We will discuss supervised learning techniques for modeling complicated functions, beginning with familiar regression schemes, then advancing to more sophisticated neural networks and deep learning methods. Next, we will cover unsupervised learning and techniques for reducing the dimensionality of input spaces and for clustering data.  We’ll show example applications from both magnetic and inertial confinement fusion.  Along the way, we will describe methods for practitioners to help ensure that their models generalize from their training data to as-yet-unseen test data.  We will finally point out some limitations to modern machine learning and speculate on some ways that practitioners from the physical sciences may be particularly suited to help.  We will also share curated fusion simulation data and sample network code to provide practical tools for learning.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Recent advances in implicit and hybrid techniques have demonstrated that finite-difference-time-domain particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation codes can effectively model volumetric and electrode plasmas at high density.  Energy-conserving implicit kinetic algorithms greatly relax the spatial Debye length and temporal plasma frequency constraints allowing for larger simulations volumes and times. Including PIC hybrid techniques further accelerates the computational speed.  These new capabilities allow for more accurate simulation of pulse-power accelerators, high power diodes, laser-plasma interactions, as well as magnetic and inertial confinement machines.  In this course, we will explore PIC methodologies for kinetic, multi-fluid and quasi neutral fluid simulation.  Hybrid techniques for blending the various PIC descriptions into a single integrated simulation will be discussed.  Finally, practical usage of these techniques in stressing plasma physics environments will also be discussed.
