The mailing list for the PPPS conference is now live. Visit the [Mailing List Website](https://listserv.ieee.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=IEEE-PPC&A=1) to sign up now for important announcements.

You can also manage your listserv subscription at the same [Mailing List Website](https://listserv.ieee.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=IEEE-PPC&A=1), where you can sign up to, and also unsubscribe from general email announcements. Note that if you unsubscribe, you may still receive specific emails (for example, about your abstract submission).
