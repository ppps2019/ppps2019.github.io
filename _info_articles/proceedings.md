PPPS 2019 has adopted the same manuscript format that has been used since the 2007 Pulsed Power & Plasma Science Conference. Please download [this Microsoft Word Template](/assets/PPC2019ManuscriptTemplate.doc) onto your hard drive and replace the titles, authors, text, figures, etc. with the content of your original manuscript.

Proceedings paper submissions are due **July 5, 2019**.

Papers must be submitted using the on-line submission system accessed via the web site: [https://indico.cern.ch/event/727938/](https://indico.cern.ch/event/727938/). This website will only accept files that have been appropriately converted to PDF format. Follow the instructions included with the template file to properly convert and upload you submission.

Information about preparing and submitting a copyright form will be posted on this webpage soon.

Your ability to follow the general guidelines and specific styles will result in fewer formatting costs and delays, as well as a more professional-looking finished paper in the PPPS Proceedings.
The guidelines for the manuscript are carefully explained in the text of [this downloadable conference template](/assets/PPC2019ManuscriptTemplate.doc). Please use the Microsoft Word file as a template when creating your manuscript so that your paper will not be rejected due to formatting errors.
