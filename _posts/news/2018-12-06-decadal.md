The US National Academies is seeking community input for their Plasma 2020 Decadal Assessment.

The US National Academies has recently started the [Decadal Assessment of Plasma Science - Plasma 2020](http://nas.edu/plasma).  As with the previous decadal assessment, [Plasma 2010](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/bpa/BPA_048210), the Plasma 2020 report will provide an overview of accomplishments in all fields of plasma science and technology during the previous decade, and provide guidance on the most critical science challenges leading to societal benefit to be addressed in the coming decade. As with Plasma 2010, it is expected that the Plasma 2020 report will be highly influential in establishing priorities for plasma focused agencies, both in the US and internationally. The Plasma 2020 committee invites the US and international plasma science and technology communities to submit white papers addressing past accomplishments, future science challenges, opportunities to provide societal benefit, needed interdisciplinary collaborations and means to enhance careers in the fields of plasma science and technology. The white papers will be a major source of input to the committee.  Instructions for submitting white papers are at the bottom of [the Plasma 2020 webpage](http://nas.edu/plasma). **Please submit white papers by February 15, 2019.**  Questions can addressed to the study Director, Christopher Jones [cjjones@nas.edu](mailto:cjjones@nas.edu) or the co-chairs of the study.
