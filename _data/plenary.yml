    This talk will review a university program that overlaps pulsed power and plasma science, and will describe applications to industrial, environmental, biomedical and defense problems.  It will present some background for the development of the research, and the ideas underlying transient plasma, or plasma in a formative phase, which is key to some of these studies. Transient plasma can produce volume ignition of various fuels and engines with lower energy cost, for example, considerably reduced delay to ignition in pulse detonation engines, higher peak pressure for internal combustion engines, and improved energy efficiencies in emissions abatement.  Biomedical applications include studies of nanosecond pulsed electric fields for the induction of programmed cell death in cancer cells _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ which have led to animal studies conducted with catheter-based pulsed power delivery systems, and the formation of commercial entities translating the research to medical applications.  Finally, a project (tenuously connected to pulsed power) to foster and encourage interest in science and engineering and improve perceptions of science in society through movies will be described.

    The stellarator Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) is equipped with a steady-state capable 10 MW ECH system, operating at 140 GHz, which corresponds to the 2nd cyclotron harmonic of electrons in the magnetic ﬁeld of 2.5 T. Ten megawatt-class gyrotrons, two 5 MW quasi-optical transmission lines (94 % transmission efficiency) as well as 4 directly steerable and 2 novel remotely steerable launchers inside the plasma vessel are operational and already delivered more than 7 MW X2-mode heating to W7-X plasmas. Besides the reliable plasma start-up and routine ECH wall conditioning, stationary discharges up to 100 s have been achieved, which were only limited by the maximum test divertor energy load. Combined with pellet injection, the highest triple product (0.68×1020 keV m−3 s), observed up to now in stellarators, was achieved, exclusively  by electron heating heating [T Sunn Pedersen et al 2019, Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 61, 014035]. The corresponding plasma parameters were Ti0=Te0=3.8 keV, ne0=0.91020 m-3 and E=0.22 s. For the ﬁrst time, dense W7-X plasmas were sustained by 2nd harmonic O-mode (O2) heating, approaching the collisionality regime for which W7-X was optimized  [T Stange, submitted to PRL]. O-mode heating needs high Te and multi-pass absorption that was obtained by tungsten covered Mo mirror tiles with holographic gratings at the inner wall.  After boronization of the plasma vessel, stationary O2-heated plasmas above the X2 cut-off with hydrogen gas fueling only; hydrogen plasmas with 6 MW ECRH for 30 s at only 1 MW divertor heat load (detached plasma), thermalization (Ti=Te=1.5 keV), density 1.61020 m-3 and radiation control with Wdia=800 kJ were achieved, which is a reference scenario for later long-pulse high density discharges. Power deposition scans did not show any indication of electron temperature proﬁle resilience. In low-density, low-power plasmas compensation of the bootstrap current with electron-cyclotron current drive (ECCD) was demonstrated [RC Wolf et al 2019 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 61, 014037]. The long discharges were used to demonstrate current control and bootstrap current compensation by ECCD. Until 2018, the plasma vessel was equipped with an uncooled divertor, which allowed to extend the integrated heating energy from 4 MJ to 80 MJ. The full steady-state capability will be reached in 2021, after an actively cooled high heat-flux divertor has been installed which can tolerate steady-state heat fluxes of up to 10 MW/m2. Plans for later upgrades include a further increase of the ECH power to 18 MW and the introduction of tungsten as a first-wall material.

  title: The Story of the LTD Development
  bio: |
    Dr. Alexander Kim was born and lives in the Siberian city of Tomsk, Russia. He attended the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute and graduated with honors in 1977. He then returned to Tomsk and joined Sergey Bugaev’s E-Beam Laboratory at the Institute of High Current Electronics (IHCE). His first task was to increase the pulse length of the e-beams generated with coaxial magnetically immersed foilless diodes, a difficult task because of centrifugal RT instability in the explosively generated cathode plasma. In 1989 Boris Kovalchuk invited him to join his group developing microsecond plasma opening switches. The goal was to increase the output power of drivers which have as a prime energy source Marx generators and intermediate inductive power amplification stages. Instead, the fast Linear Transformer Driver (LTD) was invented and developed, eliminating completely the need for power amplification. Recently the LTD technology was further developed to generate output pulses of trapezoidal shape with very fast rise time (<10 ns) and flat top, named “Square Pulse LTDs.” This new technology which replaces the sinusoidal pulse output of the standard LTD, is ideally suited for applications such as flash radiography, Z-pinch, high power microwaves, etc. Many aspects of the LTD technology are being further advanced in a close and fruitful collaboration with researchers in the USA, France, Israel and China. Alexander Kim earned a Doctor Degree in Technical Sciences from IHCE in 2002, at present he is the Leading Scientist of the IHCE Pulse Power Department.

    In this presentation the LTD development story will be presented, which begins in the 1980’s when the microsecond plasma opening switches (POS) were the focus of many pulse power scientists’ research all over the world. The accompanying problems of this technology resulted in the development of the microsecond LTD to replace the long pulse Marx generator coupled to plasma opening switches. Boris Kovalchuk’s design of the microsecond LTD cavity, in which the primary energy storage capacitors are directly integrated into the LTD structure, like the SPHINX accelerator of France, was the first crucial step towards the development of this new technology. This led to the invention of the fast (100 ns) LTDs, a natural step to follow which eliminated completely the need for pulse compression and power amplification. Most recently the LTD technology was further developed to generate output pulses of trapezoidal shape with very fast rise time (< 10ns) and flat top, named “Square Pulse LTDs.” This newest version of the technology, which replaces the sinusoidal pulse output of the standard LTD, is ideally suited for applications such as flash radiography, Z-pinch, high power microwaves, etc. In this presentation a number of different types of LTDs will be described and their operation analyzed. In addition, since an LTD cavity encloses many spark gap switches, the statistical regularity of these switches, important for the viability of LTD technology, will be discussed.

    This presentation will overview my 40 years of research and the people with whom I have had the pleasure of working, both domestically and internationally. In 1978 Sandia’s electron beam fusion program emerged from a weapons simulator community that was machine-oriented and relied on design principles and “JCM” criteria. Simulation tools were primarily used retrospectively. Fusions’ extraordinary requirements stimulated tremendous innovation in pulsed power, beams, pinches, and simulation tools. I started by developing ion beam deposition and transport models that were integrated into radiation-hydrodynamics codes; validated by experiments on Gamble II and Proto I; and helped initiate Sandia’s light ion beam fusion program. SDI program research led to the development of the ITS suite of electron-photon Monte Carlo codes (1985). Research on PBFA-I and PBFA-II on generating, transporting, and focusing ion beams required developing transport, diagnostic simulation, and analysis tools, which were used in focusing protons to 5 TW/cm2 (1991) and lithium beams to 2 TW/cm2, heating hohlraums to 65 eV (1996). They also helped identify anode plasma formation by electron heating as the source of diode impedance collapse leading to efforts to include electron-electrode interaction models into PIC codes and initiating hybrid fluid-PIC development (IPROP, LSP). Electrode physics remains a powerflow grand challenge for high yield fusion.  In 1999 I led rad-MHD development (ALEGRA-HEDP) and oversaw EOS and conductivity model development using QMD/DFT, resulting in predictive capabilities for dynamic material experiments. Improved z-pinch dynamic hohlraum modeling and experiments resulted in thermonuclear neutrons (2004). 3-D wire array dynamics were modeled and understood. We developed advanced radiographic sources and built an LTD test bed. At NRL I have overseen advances in modeling and experiments in beams, pinches, pulsed power, and their applications (2009-). My goal throughout has been to develop and validate predictive simulation tools; making Pulsed Power a Science.

    Computational plasma physics was born some fifty years ago with the development of high-speed computers. Computer simulation is well suited to the challenging nature of fundamental and applied plasma science. Plasma physics exhibits enormous ranges of time and space scales, and the underlying mathematical framework comprised of nonlinear partial differential equations and nonlinear kinetic equations does not generally admit analytic solution except in much simplified or idealized conditions. In the fifty years computational plasma physics has advanced from relatively simple calculations with limited dimensionality and scope to sophisticated and comprehensive simulation models.  Moreover, computational plasma physics has matured as a significant scientific discipline with a rigorous mathematical foundation and voluminous literature.  While computational plasma physics has greatly benefitted from the growth in computing capability by many orders of magnitude, the contributions from innovation in methods and algorithms have been no less important.<br><br> This talk presents a personal perspective on the development and application of computational plasma physics to plasmas in nature and in the laboratory.  The examples described will be based on experience over the course of a career in computational plasma physics and will illustrate both fundamental plasma phenomena and the behavior of natural and laboratory plasmas.  Some of the specific examples will include simulations of microinstabilities in magnetic mirror, tokamak, and spheromak plasmas, laser-plasma interactions, and Knudsen-layer phenomena as it affects fusion performance.  The examples also will illustrate the development of appropriate models and algorithms that were well suited to simulating the phenomena of interest efficiently. A particular interest has been the development of multiple time-scale algorithms.<br><br> I am very grateful to Professor C. K. Birdsall who provided me with my initial exposure to kinetic simulation of plasmas using particles, supported and encouraged my career, and was an enthusiastic research collaborator and friend.
