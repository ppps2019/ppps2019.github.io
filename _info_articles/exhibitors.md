We are pleased to extend to you and your company the opportunity to exhibit and sponsor events at the 2019 IEEE International Pulsed Power and Plasma Science Conference (PPPS).

[Download the Prospectus](/assets/exhibitor_prospectus.pdf)

Being a conference exhibitor or sponsor is a tremendous way to expose your company to a broad spectrum of industrial, government, and university organizations and a way to prospect for both immediate and future business. Your competitors will likely be there and we sincerely hope you will too! Please see the [Exhibitor and Sponsorship Prospectus](/assets/exhibitor_prospectus.pdf) for specific details on how your company can participate. There are limited exhibitor booths and sponsor events available and you are therefore encouraged to sign up as soon as possible in order to receive your preferred choices. Priority for booth location and event sponsorship choices will be given on a first come, first served basis based on the receipt date of the application and accompanying reservation deposit.

The figure below shows the booth layout planned in the Exhibits area in the Universal Center Exhibit Hall. Thirty (30) booths have been arranged in this space. All poster sessions and food and beverage breaks will be held in the Exhibit Hall to maximize the attendee traffic through the exhibitor space.
