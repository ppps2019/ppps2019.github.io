A Job Posting Board will be made available for participants in the conference!  We will have a poster board set up near the meeting rooms, where prospective employers&mdash;including those in industry, the national labs, and universities&mdash;may put up active job openings.  Individuals looking for a new career may peruse the postings and contact members of the recruiting teams that are present at the conference &ndash; as is convenient for both parties!
