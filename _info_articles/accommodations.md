The conference venue for the 2019 IEEE Pulsed Power & Plasma Science Conference is:

[DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel at the Entrance to Universal](http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/florida/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-at-the-entrance-to-universal-orlando-MCOUNDT/index.html) \\
5780 Major Blvd., Orlando, Florida, 32819, USA \\
TEL: +1-407-351-1000\\
FAX: +1-407-363-0106

The Conference Registration does __not__ include hotel accommodations. Check back here soon for instructions for getting the group rate at this hotel.

PPPS 2019 will be held in the meeting space of DoubleTree at the Entrance to Universal, with Universal Studios located literally across the street and within walking distance.  DoubleTree at the Entrance to Universal is also the recommended hotel for lodging as we have negotiated a very low group rate and the meeting space is directly connected to the hotel.  The DoubleTree has just finshed a complete renovation of the meeting space and hotel rooms, which will provide a fresh, contemporary, venue for PPPS 2019.
